  <h1>The EDA Experience</h1>
  <h4>Sunday 21'st December 2014</h4>

      <!--what's your take on the EDA experience? What is your impression of EDA? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?-->
      For me as a student fresh out of high school what stood out about the EDA experience is the approach of not grading submissions on how good they are and instead looking at how engaged you are in the content and how well you are progressing. I feel this is a very clever way of doing it as everyone is different and will learn and expresses differently.
      Another point that stood out to is the EQ factor of EDA, something that is never even mentioned in High School. IQ can only take you so far, improving your EQ will help your ability to control emotions, learn and progress. I hope to engage well in the culture of Dev Academy and am excited to work harder than I ever have before.

      When I first signed up for Dev Academy I thought it would be very similar to a University course, just shorter. But now I realize it is so much more. It's a fully immersive program that focuses on teaching a base of knowledge that will allow you to get paid to learn more.This base of knowledge is not only coding, but also a lot of soft skills that employers look for.
