  <div id=content><h3>Hey Ira, what's the difference between Margins, Borders, and Padding?</h3>
    <p>
      Firstly, a border is like an outline and in css this can be used to outline div, text or just about anything. In css there are many different attributes you can apply to a border such as thickness, style, color, and you can even define if you want a full border or just specific sides. I have included an example of a border and the code that it uses.
      <!--<a href="myfile.htm"><img src="imgs/border_css.png"></a>-->
    </p>
    <p>
      The padding tag relates strongly to the border tag as it defines the space inside the border. By default the border will wrap as close to the content as possible, and with padding you can have control over this. If you don't want a border padding is still important, as it defines space around your content that should be left empty. Here is an example of padding in use and the code used to create it.
      <!--<a href="myfile.htm"><img src="imgs/padding_css.png"></a>-->
    </p>
    <p>
      Margin is very similar to padding except instead of defining the space inside the border it defines the space outside the border. Effectively clearing an area around your content.
      <!--<a href="myfile.htm"><img src="imgs/margin_css.png"></a>-->

  <div id=content><h3>The EDA Experience</h3>
    For me as a student fresh out of high school what stood out about the EDA experience is the approach of not grading submissions on how good they are and instead looking at how engaged you are in the content and how well you are progressing. I feel this is a very clever way of doing it as everyone is different and will learn and expresses differently.
      Another point that stood out to is the EQ factor of EDA, something that is never even mentioned in High School. IQ can only take you so far, improving your EQ will help your ability to control emotions, learn and progress.

      I hope to engage well in the culture of Dev Academy the only thing I am worried about is that I think of myself as more of an introvert and may have a bit of trouble engaging in some of the peer based work, although I and am excited to work harder than I ever have before and hopefully get past this.

      When I first signed up for Dev Academy I thought it would be very similar to a University course, just shorter. But now I realize it is much more. It's a fully immersive program that focuses on teaching a base of knowledge that will allow you to get paid to learn more.This base of knowledge is not only coding, but also a lot of soft skills that employers look for.
