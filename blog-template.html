  <div id=content><h3>Cyber Security</h3>
    <p>
      An issue facing the tech industry currently is cybersecurity. A company may have to weigh up whether it's worth moving data onto cloud storage where it may be more vulnerable or whether to encrypt data etc.. A lot of buinesses don't give enough attention to cyber security until after an attack because it is often not a pressing issue until it happens but it can result in financial losses, intellectual property theft, reputational damage, fraud and many other negative impacts on buinesses.

  <div id=content><h3>Map, Map! </h3>
    <p>
      In ruby the method 'Map' apply's code to each seperate thing in an array. For example if you wanted to add something onto the end of each element in your array <code> streams =[karearea, kakapo, hihi]  streams.map {|stream| puts stream + ' is a type of bird'} </code> would give you <code>karearea is a type of bird kakapo is a type of bird  hihi is a type of bird</code>. 'Map!' does the same except instead of returning a new array it edits the original.

  <div id=content><h3>Thinking Style</h3>
    <p>
      My Gregorc thinking style is Abstract Sequential. A trait of this thinking style that may affect my time at EDA positively is that this thinking style enjoys applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems. Abstract Sequential thinkers also learn best when they have access to experts so EDA should be the perfect environment for learning with this thinking style. Concrete Random was very close behind in the thinking style test. The fact that this type of thinker enjoys experimenting to find solutions could benifit me during my time at EDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest struggle for me so far in phase 0 has probably been the ruby exercises this week. I found it tough interpreting some of the ruby excersise tasks due to being new to ruby, which is listed as a issue Abstract Sequential thinkers may have a hard time getting past. However I got past this through a lot of trial and error which is a trait of Concrete Random thinkers.

  <div id=content><h3>The difference betweens arrays and hashes</h3>
    <p>
      In Ruby an array is just like a list, it is data stored in an order. You can look up each data entry by using the number it comes on the list. For example if our list was 'Red, White, Blue', <code>colour_array[0]</code> would give you <code>"Red"</code> and <code>colour_array[1]</code> would give you <code>"White"</code></p>
    <p>
      Hashes are very similar to arrays, however instead of using a number to look up each thing on the list you use a unique name called a key that you have assigned to each list item. For example if you were to make the list 'Musician - Michael Jackson, Actor - George Clooney, Artist - Pablo Picasso' <code>famous_hash["Musician"]</code> would give you <code>"Michael Jackson"</code> and <code>famous_hash["Artist"]</code> would give you <code>"Pablo Picasso"</code>.

  <div id=content><h3>The difference between Margins, Borders, and Padding</h3>
    <p>
      Firstly, a border is like an outline and in css this can be used to outline div, text or just about anything. In css there are many different attributes you can apply to a border such as thickness, style, color, and you can even define if you want a full border or just specific sides. I have included an example of a border and the code that it uses.
      <!-- <a href="myfile.htm"><img src="imgs/border_css.png"></a> -->
    </p>
    <p>
      The padding tag relates strongly to the border tag as it defines the space inside the border. By default the border will wrap as close to the content as possible, and with padding you can have control over this. If you don't want a border padding is still important, as it defines space around your content that should be left empty. Here is an example of padding in use and the code used to create it.
      <!-- <a href="myfile.htm"><img src="imgs/padding_css.png"></a> -->
    </p>
    <p>
      Margin is very similar to padding except instead of defining the space inside the border it defines the space outside the border. Effectively clearing an area around your content.
      <!-- <a href="myfile.htm"><img src="imgs/margin_css.png"></a> -->
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id=content><h3>The EDA Experience</h3>
    For me as a student fresh out of high school what stood out about the EDA experience is the approach of not grading submissions on how good they are and instead looking at how engaged you are in the content and how well you are progressing. I feel this is a very clever way of doing it as everyone is different and will learn and expresses differently.
      Another point that stood out to is the EQ factor of EDA, something that is never even mentioned in High School. IQ can only take you so far, improving your EQ will help your ability to control emotions, learn and progress.

      I hope to engage well in the culture of Dev Academy the only thing I am worried about is that I think of myself as more of an introvert and may have a bit of trouble engaging in some of the peer based work, although I and am excited to work harder than I ever have before and hopefully get past this.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I first signed up for Dev Academy I thought it would be very similar to a University course, just shorter. But now I realize it is much more. It's a fully immersive program that focuses on teaching a base of knowledge that will allow you to get paid to learn more.This base of knowledge is not only coding, but also a lot of soft skills that employers look for.
